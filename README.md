# RidgeGPT

Due to school blocking ChatGPT, I have implemented the API key and made a fully functioning replica of the website but now on my local host, where it can not be restricted.


## Installation

Clone project using git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DerpNerdd/RidgeGPT.git
cd ChatGPT
```

Download Dependencies
```bash
*In Terminal*
npm i 
```

Run the program

```bash
*In Terminal*
For normal use: npm run start
For developer use: npm run dev
```

## Planning

- Will make it look more accurate to ChatGPT's UI
- Will eventually add image uploading 
- Will eventually add multiple sessions
- May charge $1-$5 for users to use
